Setup


1) 

- Created shell script as specified to test the issue that running [la -A]
 yields. 
- Copied the two lines from the CS 35L website into a text file named la.
- issue is still present, using lnxsrv04 with ls version 8.2.4
- the -A option does not override the -a option.


Building a copy of Coreutils 8.29


1) 

- Download Coreutils 8.29 source code compressed tarball, the signature, and
the GNU keyring onto the SEAS server with [wget link], replacing link with
each of the urls.
- [gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig]
- There is a warning with this command. The key is not certified with a 
trusted signature, meaning that although the public key used to verify the 
signature is valid, the public key itself is not certified to be the public
key of the author of the source code, whether the reason is because the 
source code is outdated, and thus the true author's public key has changed,
or because gpg has not verified the owner of this public key.


2)

- [tar -xf tarball] where tarball is the name of the Coreutils 8.29 source 
code tarball
	- extracts files from the tarball (-x option), specifying that it is a 
	file (-f option)
- [cd coreutils-8.29], [cat INSTALL | less]
	- enter the uncompressed file and read the installation section on 
	Prefix
	- run ./configure and make and make install
	- to install this under a specified directory, add [--prefix=PREFIX],
	where PREFIX is an absolute 
	directory (this will add some modifications to the created makefile)
- [./configure --prefix=directory], where directory is my intended temporary
 directory
	- confirms dependencies and creates a makefile
- [make]
	- compiles source code into runnable program, based on makefile
- [make install]
	- copies compiled program into system directories (in this case, the one
	specified during configuration) so that it can be run from any 
	directory 
- no bugs ran into


3) 

- [cd ..]
- [coreutilsTemp/bin/ls -aA]
	- run ls command on the current directory from the previously 
	installed version of coreutils ls
	- the bug is reproduced, as the '.' and '..' directories are listed, 
	meaning the -A option did not override the -a option
- [coreutilsTemp/bin/ls -A] itself hides the '.' and '..' directories
as expected


4) 

- [emacs patch.diff], then copy and paste diff results from Eggert's patch
- [cd path] to change back into the coreutils-8.29 directory and apply the
 patch
- [patch -p1 < patch.diff]
	- add -p1 option to strip to the first forward slash in the path to 
	original and modified file paths that are specified in patch.diff
- no errors encountered


5) 

- [make] to re-compile the patched files
	- warnings: "automake-1.15 is missing from your system"
	- [autoreconf -fi] to resolve
- There were many files copied in order to re-apply the changes to the 
files. This makes sense because the patch changes files and all these files
need to be applied to the appropriate locations. Make will compile the
changes into an executable program, but the changes need to be applied 
everywhere.


6)

- [cd ..]
- [coreutils-8.29/src/ls -aA]
- ran the patched version on the current directory and also on /usr/bin
- '.' and '..' directories are now hidden and the patch was successful
- [coreutilsTemp/bin/ls -aA]
- reran the old unpatched version as well to confirm the prior error
